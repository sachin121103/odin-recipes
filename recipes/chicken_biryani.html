    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Biryani is an intricate rice dish made with layers of curried meat and rice. Given its use of 
    adornments and luxurious finishes, it’s no surprise that biryani has roots in Persian cuisine.</p>

    <p>In Pakistan, pakki (or cooked) biryani is most common, with several prominent varieties such as 
    Sindhi, Karachi-style, and Bombay biryani. This recipe is an amalgamation of these styles and 
    is similar to what you’d find at a typical Pakistani or Indian restaurant or dinner party.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 lbs (567 g) bone-in, cut up, skinless chicken, cleaned and excess skin removed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (115 g) plain whole milk yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp neutral oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp biryani masala (recipe in post), or sub store-bought biryani masala</li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cumin powder</li>
        <li>1/2-1 tsp red chili powder, start with 1/2 tsp if using store-bought biryani masala</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp nutmeg powder</li>
        <li>pinch cane sugar, omit if using store-bought biryani masala</li>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt, start with 1 ¼ tsp if using store-bought biryani masala</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups (~325-350 g) aged, long grain basmati rice</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp lemon juice or vinegar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the chicken with the ingredients listed under ‘marinade’. Cover and set 
            aside or refrigerate (ideally) up to overnight. When ready to use, allow the chicken to come 
            to room temperature.</li>

        <li>Thoroughly wash the rice and soak it in water. Set aside.</li>

        <li>Heat a large, heavy bottomed pan over high heat. Add the oil, ghee, and onions and sauté until 
            the onions are golden (~15-20 minutes). Deglaze the pan with ¼ cup water. Once the water dries 
            up, add the whole spices, garlic, and ginger and sauté for another 2 minutes.</li>

        <li>Add the chicken with its marinade and sauté until it changes color (~2-3 minutes). Add the 
            tomatoes, green chili pepper, and dried plum (alu bukhara) and stir to coat. Add ½ cup water 
            (the water should cover about 1/3 of the chicken) and bring to a gentle boil.</li>

        <li>Turn the heat down to a gentle simmer (this is low heat on my stovetop), cover, and allow the 
            chicken to cook for 30 minutes, stirring midway. While the chicken is cooking, proceed to the 
            next step. Turn off the heat once the chicken has cooked.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the rice. Place a medium pot over high heat and bring 7 cups (1.75 quarts) 
            of water to a boil (See Tip). Add salt, oil, and lemon juice/vinegar and stir. Once the water 
            comes to a boil, drain and add the rice. Stir, and bring it back up to a boil. Once it comes 
            to a boil again, boil for 5 minutes (no more than 5 minutes and 30 seconds), or until the rice is
            just cooked with a bite to it. It shouldn’t get mushy when pressed between your fingers. 
            (See Note 1) Drain and set aside.</li>

        <li>Uncover the chicken. Raise the heat to medium-high to sauté out any excess water for 2-3 minutes. 
            Add salt, garam masala, and red chili flakes for more heat (if desired). The oil will have 
            separated from the ‘masala’. Turn off the heat. Add kewra water and lemon juice and stir to 
            combine.</li>
    </ol>
